# wine-quality

This project analyzing wine quality was submitted to my Machine Learning for the Social Sciences course in the Fall of 2021. In particular, I do the following:

1. Use *K Means Cluster Analysis* and the elbow curve tuning method to find clusters of observations w/high and low values of wine quality, and use the findings to determine which characteristics are important
2. Employ *Hierarchical Cluster Analysis* to identify clusters of observations that have high and low values of the wine quality, then use the information to identify variables that cluster with higher values of wine quality
3. Conduct *PCA* to determine how much variation of the data can be explained by the first 2 components.
